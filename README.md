# The Riot API Introduction by iTero Gaming

I'm Jack J and I'm the Founder & Lead Data Scientist for iTero Gaming. I've written an introduction the Riot API which I've been using for over 5 years, with sections such as:

- Getting set-up
- Your first API call
- Gathering Data
- Adding Arguments
- Dealing with Rate Limits

By the end of the guide you should be able to successfully build a script to takes any Summoner Name and print out information about their 100 most recent solo queue games, such as most kills in a game or best KDA on a champion. 

You can join our Discord to ask questions, show off what you're building or get inspiration: https://discord.gg/DmSUDGEW6V
